# Protobuf Message Monitor

This project displays Protocol Buffer messages on an Internet Browser received from a TCP socket.
By default, the nodejs receives the messages at port 4000 using TCP sockets. Then they are displayed, in the browser, at port 3700.
At the browser all messages arrive closed, but a simple mouse click will opens them for a better visualization experience.
